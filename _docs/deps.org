* Deps
** Where possible, I use submodules to pull in dependencies
** Where no submodule exists, then I will commit upstream code directly.
** Updating submodules
To update the submodules, use git submodule foreach git fetch --all.
Then note which ones have pulled in new commits.
Look at the logs and/or diff HEAD with origin and see what's new.
If it all looks ok, git pull --rebase the submodule.
Then add and commit the updated submodule ref.
